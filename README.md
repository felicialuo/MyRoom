# MyRoom
 
## Project Description
* MyRoom is a user-friendly 2D room planner for anyone to plan for their bedroom furniture layout. Users will be able to drop a default room to the drawing space, and then move the wall and door/window. They can then drag and drop, move, rotate, and flip furniture in the room plan. There will be a furniture library provided, each with a default dimension. Once the 2D plan is finalized, users will be able to switch to a test mode to test accessibility, and visualize any part of the room that is not wide enough to walk through.
* Watch the video for demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAskzKZYSlU&t=3s.
